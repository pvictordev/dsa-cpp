# Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

This repo contains implementations of core data structures and algorithms in C++.

## How it works

To simplify the compile-and-run workflow, I created a Bash script that continuously watches for file changes, recompiles the code, and reruns the application.

## How to run

1. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pvictordev/dsa-cpp.git
```

2. Run the script or use make run:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/build-and-run.sh
./scripts/build-and-run.sh
```
