# Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

This repo contains implementations of core data structures and algorithms in C++.

## Getting started

1. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pvictordev/dsa-cpp.git
```

2. Install the following packages:
   `sudo dnf install entr` , `sudo dnf install gcc-c++`

3. Run the script or use make run:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/build-and-run.sh
./scripts/build-and-run.sh
```

## How it works

- To simplify the compile-and-run workflow, I created a Bash script that continuously watches for file changes, recompiles the code, and reruns the application.
- When you start the program, you first select the option you want to run. On subsequent restarts, your previous selection is cached in the application state, so you donâ€™t need to go through the same menu steps again after each rebuild.
